	\section*{Types of Data}
	\textbf{Numeric/Quantitative} -- consists of numbers representing counts or measurements
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\textit{Continuous} --} results from infinitely many possible quantitative values, where the collection of values is not countable.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Examples:} Age, Height, Weight
			\item Volume, Temperature, Distance, Time, Speed, Acceleration
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\textit{Discrete} --} results when the data values are quantitative and the number of values are countable or finite.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Examples:} Number of students in a classroom, number of defective parts
			\item Number of quarters in a piggy bank, number of calls coming into a call center 
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Categorical/Qualitative} -- consists of names or labels that are not numbers representing counts or measurements
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\textit{Nominal} --} characterized by data that consists of names, labels, or categories only.
		\item Data cannot be arranged in an ordering scheme
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Examples:} Color of eyes, religious affiliation, blood type, marital status, cuisine type, car model, operating system
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\textit{Ordinal} --} can be arranged in some order
		\item Differences between data values have meaning or can be calculated
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Examples:} Grades of A,B,C,etc., Critics list of the top 50 movies of all times, satisfaction ratings, pain scale
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section*{Design of Experiments (DOE)}
	\subsection*{What is a designed experiment?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Powerful data collection and analysis tool.
		\item Investigator observes how a response variable (yield, strength, cost) behaves when the researcher \textbf{manipulates} one or more factors/treatments (temperature, speed, vendor)
		\item[$\cdot$] \textbf{Goal:} To determine the effect of explanatory variables/factors on the response
		\item[$\cdot$] \textbf{Questions you are answering with DOE:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[$\cdot$] What happens when...?
			\item[$\cdot$] What is the effect of...?
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{Why designed experiments?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Causality -- can confidently attribute observed changes to specific factors
		\item Minimize Bias -- ensures any difference in the groups are due to chance
		]item Cost and Time Efficiency -- using a well designed experiment researcher can save time and money to ensure good data
	\end{itemize}
